1-what is the benefit of using master-slave architecture rather than building on master only ?

2-try to make new agent as container using docker plugin  and configure master to use it and build pipeline on this agent

3-run pipeline to run bash script located on github repo 

4-run new pipeline using jenkins shared library to build, push dockerfile existed on github repo
